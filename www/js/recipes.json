    "Description": "The inspiration for this recipe came from one of my favourite chefs, vegan guru Tal Ronen who likes to use ancient grains. Tapping into my own ancient Horn of Africa heritage with its African and Middle Eastern influences I have used hulled millet, pomegranate and added ingredients that I don�t usually use such as black quinoa and artichokes. Millet is a common food in much of Africa where it is eaten as a breakfast food in the form of porridge. It is also cooked into a stiff polenta like dish that is served with either vegetables or a meat based sauce.�While many rave about quinoa, millet is not as well known in the western world, but it should be. It is a smart carb that is low GI and has been shown to produce lower blood sugar levels than wheat or rice. (Kamari and Sumathi, 2002). I also used artichokes in this recipe, a vegetable that I am not very familiar with. I have included pictures of how they look like before and after preparation below. Slice about 3/4 inch to an inch off the tip of the artichoke. Pull off any smaller leaves towards the base and on the stem. Wash them in cold water and boil them for about 30 minutes in water. See picture below for what the artichokes should look like once prepared. And this is what your dish could look like once cooked and all the ingredients assembled on the serving plate.

    "Description": "I was beyond flattered when I given the daunting challenge of putting my own twist to the famous chef Tal Ronnen�s vegan menu at the Wynn Luxury Resort in Las Vegas. I started the task with quite a bit of trepidation! This guy is one of the world�s most celebrated chefs, runs the Crossroads restaurant in Los Angeles, and is the author of The Conscious Cook, a New York Times bestselling cookbook. Tal Ronnen is also someone Oprah calls the world�s best vegan chef. I was also daunted by the fact that I had to choose one dish from the menus of the numerous restaurants at the Wynn , named in the�Cond� Nast Traveller� Gold List �as one of the �Top Hotels in the World�. I chose an organic olive oil seared tofu dish prepared with sundried tomatoes, green onions, ginger and lemon soy from Andrea�s, a Forbes Travel Guide Four Star award winning restaurant. I wanted to put a Somali touch to this dish and the idea of using fenugreek seeds and leaves came to mind. Fenugreek is used as a herb (fresh or dried) and a spice when in seed form. In Somali, we call it� hulbad (xulbad) . It is used to spice food and also as a herbal medicine to help women who are breast feeding improve their milk flows. I also decided to substitute the sun dried tomatoes in the original dish with fresh red and gold cherry tomatoes and saut�ed them in fenugreek flavoured oil and lime juice. The resulting juices acted as my dressing and was used in lieu of the lemon soy. I also added rocket leaves as I thought their peppery flavour would go well with the other ingredients. I was delighted with the delicate flavour imparted by the distinctive sweetness of the fenugreek seeds. The fresh tartness of the lime and the slightly caramelised onions, rocket, tomatoes and ginger added a tasty layer of flavour to the tofu. This is definitely a dish that I will cook again. Tal Ronnen, if you ever happen to read my humble take on your dish I hope you think I did a good interpretation! �And to anyone who uses this recipe, I hope you will enjoy the dish as much as I did.

How to wrap the sambuus pastry (see pictures above) 1: Thaw the spring roll pastry and cover with a clean cloth to keep the pastry from drying out. 2: Mix two tablespoons of plain flour with a quarter cup of warm water to form a paste to seal the pastry�s edge. 3: Cut the two pastry sheets into thirds of equal size rectangles.� Repeat for the rest of the pastries, using two sheets at a time. In total, you will have 15 rectangles, each forming into one sambuus. Ensure that the pastry pieces are always kept covered with a clean cloth. 4: Fold the two sheets of rectangular pastry into pockets � see picture below. 5: Fill the pocket with about two tablespoons of the vegetable mixture. 6: Spread the flour paste along the edges of the final fold and seal the pastry completely. Ensure that the pastry does not have any holes.� You should have a neat triangular sambuus . A well folded sambuus will fry crisply and won�t be oily. 7: Repeat the process of filling and folding with the remaining pieces of pastry. Keep the pasties covered in cloth to ensure they don�t dry out. Frying the sambuus 1: Heat up oil in a deep frying pan on medium heat. Test the oil with a small strip of excess dough and if the pastry floats up then you are ready to start frying your sambuus . 2: Fry several sambuus at a time until they are a nice golden colour. 3: Drain the sambuus on a clean kitchen towel and serve with a wedge of lemon, lime or shidni sauce. � Prep time: 30 minutes Cook time: 2 hours Total time: 2.5 hours Serves: 8 - 10 people Share this recipe: Facebook Pinterest Google+ Twitter Email You might also like",

    "Description": "Fried coffee? I know what you are thinking! It sounds weird, right? But let me tell you the taste is incredible and Somalis have some interesting stories that we associate with the bean. My beloved maternal grandparents introduced me to fried coffee beans at the tender age of five. This special dish was offered during meditation sessions called dhikr , an Islamic form of devotional chanting in praise of God. Somehow to this day, the smell of coffee brings to mind the sonorous, repetitive and ancient sounds of sacred chant, and I get instantly transported to a state of mental clarity. The d hikr group would sit on a mat and the coffee would be served floating in oil in a kurbin , a special wooden bowl. The kurbin would be passed around and we would start with a deep and appreciative sniff of the wonderful aroma, and then ladle a spoonful of the coffee onto the palm, chew the beans, and then rub the scented oil over our faces. This was part of the ritual and was said to prepare the person to face the world. Sometimes sugar is added to the bun to sweeten it.� Bun is also often eaten with popcorn or a simple dish of boiled azuki beans known as cambuulo . Coffee beans are called� bun �in the Somali language, and� buna �in Oromo and� bunna �in Amharic, the two other main languages of Ethiopia, the home of coffee. Somalis also associate bun with rites and spirit possession practices that hint at the ancient beliefs of Somalis. Ceremonies are held by a ritual expert, calanqad . Dancing, drumming, bun and the burning of incense are used to enhance the senses of participants. The spirit descends on the host under various names, sometimes speaking in different languages. Men and women participate in a ceremony called mingis , but women have their own ceremony called saar . If the spirit is vexatious, an exorcism is conducted by the calanqad . Not all spirits are cast out. Some become friends of the possessed person and are sometimes inherited by the children. Fried coffee beans also play a central role in ceremonies women hold to pray for the safe delivery of a pregnant friend. The oil used to fry the coffee beans is applied liberally on the head and hair of the pregnant woman as the women pray and sing for their friend. The Oromo people of Ethiopia, a Cushitic tribe like the Somali, also have a fried coffee ceremony. The outer skin is snipped off the coffee beans and words of blessings are uttered in a ritual known as buna-chiru , which signifies sacrifice to honour a guest or for a ceremony.

    "Description": "Samosa or sambuus as we call it in Somali is a deep fried triangular shaped pastry filled with meat and spices. It is commonly made for afternoon tea � asariya . Our house in Malindi was like a little bakery. We would start cooking at 6am, making samosas and other pastries for my mother�s shop and my brother�s restaurant. It was my job to help stuff the samosas with meat or vegetables and fold them up. I was also the delivery person, dropping off the hot pastries at the restaurant on my way to school. Thanks to the demands of the shop and restaurant we got to enjoy samosas everyday! This recipe is based on how my mother made her samosas. Everything is made from scratch. You can use store bought pastry, but the extra effort of making your own pastry is worth it. Serve with a wedge of lemon and shidni sauce .

Place in the fridge for one hour. I use two meats because beef on its own can be dry while lamb on its own is too oily. So the combination gives you a lovely tasting meat. 2.�Dice the onion and chop the coriander. 3.�Saute the mince in a sauce pan until cooked through. 4.�Add the onion and coriander and cook for a minute or two. 5.�Season with salt. 6.�Let the mixture cool. Samosa pastry 1.�Place plain flour, oil and the warm water in the bowl and mix until you have a smooth dough 2.�Divide the dough into small tennis ball sized pieces 3.�Roll three dough balls out flat, each to size of a saucer. 4.�Spread a little oil on top of each round and stack them one on top of the other. The oil prevents the� dough rounds sticking to each other. 5.�Roll the stacks to roughly the size of a dinner place. Cut into quarters. 6.�Dry fry the quarters on both sides one at a time for a minute on each side. Don�t overcook! 7.�When each quarter is dry-fried separate them and wrap with plastic. How to wrap the samosas 1.�Mix two tablespoons of plain flour with a quarter cup of warm water to form a paste to seal the samosa edge. 2.�Form each quarter into a cone shape by folding the sides from the rounded end over each other and seal with the paste. You should have a cone shape with a triangular shaped top that looks like an ice cream cone. 3.�Fill the cone with the mince mixture. 4.�Tuck the pointed top end down over the sealed edges and seal with the paste. You should now have a neat triangular samosa. Repeat with remaining pieces of pastry. Cooking the samosas 1.�Heat the oil in heavy shallow frying pan over medium heat. Test the oil with a small strip of excess dough and if the pastry floats up then you are ready to start frying your samosas. 2.�Place several samosas in your frying pan. Turn to brown to a light gold. 3.�Drain the cooked samosas on paper. � Prep time: 1 hour Cook time: 20 minutes Total time: 1 hour and 20 minutes Serves: 6 - 8 people Share this recipe: Facebook Pinterest Google+ Twitter Email You might also like",

    "Name": "Just my cup of tea � Somali shaah redolent with spices",
    "Description": "There is a fine tradition in Somali society known as casariya , a word that is loosely translated to mean afternoon tea. Wonderfully spiced tea called shaah in Somali is often served with various types of sweet or savoury treats. And you never, ever have shaah without sheeko (stories)! If you get invited to a Somali household for casariya beware that you won�t get asked how you like your tea. You will be served tea just the way Somalis like � full of spices and sugar! Cardamom is usually the strongest scent in Somali shaah . Somalis will often ask for tea that has so much cardamom that it should make the person sneeze! Tea with milk is called shaah cadays , however, it is customary to serve black tea called shaah bigays after a heavy meal. This recipe is from Nadia Faragaab aka the �Shaah Queen of Melbourne�. Nadia makes exceptional Somali shaah and always has a good sheeko or two up her sleeve! Nadia started making shaah when she was about 10 years. �My family decided that as the tomboy in the family I should learn to make shaah . It was a way of inducting me into housework,� she jokingly says. �I was also taught how to make canjeero (a Somali sourdough pancake) for breakfast, but I quickly realised that waking up at the crack of dawn wasn�t quite my thing. Making shaah wasn�t dependent on an early morning wake-up call so it became my thing,� adds Nadia. According to Nadia, the interesting thing about making shaah is that somehow each cook�s tea tastes different. �It is almost as if they�ve added a bit of themselves to the tea,� she says. Well, without much ado, here is Nadia�s shaah recipe. Make it your own! This recipe makes four cups of tea.

The shushumow also known as kalkals or zinanaande �(in Somali and Barawa languages) is shaped into small balls that is flattened and curled over a fork, deep fried and then tossed in a sugar syrup. The pastry shells are shaped using a fork and sometimes an afro comb (yes, you read that correctly, but of course use a new and sanitised one!). This recipe is courtesy of Hibo Jama of MyHalwad , a great instagram page that you should visit.�Hibo says that she chose the name MyHalwad �because she loves halwa (or xalwa , a popular Somali sweet). �I love xalwad . One day I was craving for it, but where I used to live there was no one who made it. They only got it from other cities. So I called my sister, and as always she told me how to cook xalwa over the phone step by step. It took me about ten tries or so, but I finally got it. Now I put my own twist on it, and that is where the name MyHalwad came from. Xalwa is one of my favorite things to cook,� she says. Hibo started cooking when she was a teenager, but the passion for cooking kicked some years later. �Now I love cooking and baking, and I have been cooking different cuisines for the last 14 years.

Make sure the comb is new and sanitised, and only use it for the shushumow . Instructions Preparing the shushumow 1. In an electric mixer mix all dough ingredients together except the water (and frying oil of course!) 2. Add the water slowly until you get soft dough. Mix for about 4-5 minutes. 3. Then let the dough rest for about 30 minutes. 4. Next cut the dough into small pieces roughly 1 inch x 1 inch. This should give you about 30 shushumow . 5. Shape them one at a time by pressing the dough on the back of the fork and curl it out toward the opposite side (away from you) 6. Preheat oil on medium heat. Fry the shushumow in the preheated oil a few at time, until golden brown. Make sure you turn the pastry frequently so that it cooks evenly. 7. Take them out and place them on a few layers of paper towels. This helps drain the oil from pastry. Preparing the syrup 1. For the syrup, use a medium size pan combine the sugar, cardamom and water together and let it come to a boil. Simmer for a couple of minutes and turn off the heat. 2. Then add all the shushumow to the pan and stir gently and ensure an even coating of the syrup. 3. Take the shushumow out and put them on a plate and let them cool down.

Growing up in Mombasa on the Kenyan coast I remember waking up to the call of the vitumbua sellers � vitumbua moto moto (hot, hot vitumbua ). Traditionally, we make the rice cakes in a small hollow pan which holds one cake at a time, but I couldn�t find this type of pan in Australia where I live now. Then a friend told me about the Danish Aebleskiver pan, a cast iron utensil that usually has nine holes � just perfect for cooking mini cakes and I was back in business! You can get the Aebleskiver pan on Amazon or eBay. Incidentally, the macsharo yariis recipe can also be used to make rice pancakes called vibibi and a rice cake also called macsharo or mkate wa sinia in Swahili. This recipe makes about 30 mini cakes.

    "Name": "Somali Polenta Flat Bread (Muufo)",
    "Description": "Traditionally, Somalis bake muufo in a special clay oven called tinaar that is heated by charcoal. The muufo is flattened and stuck on the walls of the tinaar. No oil is ever used. You know the muufo is ready when it falls off the wall. � Muufo is a wonderful bread to serve with soup or stew. As Somalis settled in countries where they didn�t have access to a tinaar , they adapted by using a frying pan or a grill. Once the muufo is cooked on one side, the pan is flipped over to cook the other side directly over the gas flames. The result is an equally delicious flatbread though I have to say that the charcoal cooked tinaar gives the muufo a unique smoky flavour. Some people like to toast the muufo directly over the gas flames by flipping the frying pan onto the heat. This gives the muufo a charred look that makes the taste reminiscent of the muufo cooked in the traditional tinaar . Muufo cooked in this fashion is called muufo gedis (i.e. muufo that is turned). This method of cooking became popular in Somalia during the war as many small businesses such as the tinaar bakery shut down for safety reasons. Visits to the tinaar bakery are a nostalgic memory for girls who grew up in Somalia. It was the duty of young girls to buy the bread at the local tinaar . They would be given a tea towel or small bag to hold the bread and some money. Often, there would be a queue of people waiting for their muufo to be baked. The wait gave the girls a chance to catch up with friends and play. This recipe is from Faiza Hassan, a Somali Sydneysider, who is a wonderful cook. She remembers her mother making muufo in the tinaar in their house. It was years later in Australia that she wrote down her mother�s recipe and used the frying pan and grill to make the muufo bread.

Anjero (written as canjeero in Somali) is also known as lahooh ( laxoox ). It is similar to the massive sized Ethiopian injera bread. The Somali version is smaller � dinner plate sized and thinner. Somalis make their anjero in various ways. Some people add eggs to the batter. Others use flours such as sorghum. Some Somalis don�t ferment their batter, but I like my anjero fermented. Fermentation gives anjero a tangy sourdough taste that is very moreish! The fermentation process takes two days. Keep a cupful of fermented batter in the fridge to start a fresh batch if you want to make more anjero. Breads similar to anjero are common in Yemen (where it is called lahoh ) and Israel where it was introduced by Yemeni Jews.

My grandmother used to say that you would know a good cook by the flakiness of their sabayaad . Well, here is how you can make yours as flaky as my granny would want it! You can use all purpose white flour, but this results in a chewy sabaayad. I prefer adding in wholemeal wheat flour which makes the sabaayad soft. To make a circular shaped sabaayad , use your hands to roll the circle from one end to form a cigar like roll. Hold one end and roll into a snake like coil and tuck the end in. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a thin circle. My grandmother rolled the dough twice applying oil with each roll. She said this makes the sabaayad extra flaky and I have to agree that this process does make for a super flaky bread. To make the sabaayad extra flaky roll the dough slightly after spreading the first tablespoonful of oil into a circle or a square. Roll it out again into a bigger circle or square ready for cooking.

Mix all the flour together with the salt. Add the oil and mix in thoroughly. Add in the water slowly as you knead the dough. When you are satisfied that you have a firm and elastic dough you know you�ve got it right. Let the dough rest for about half an hour. 2. Cut the dough into eight equal portions. Roll out each portion into a circle. Spread one teaspoon of oil and rub it gently all over the surface of the dough. To make the sabaayad square shaped, use a rolling pin to roll the circle and fold it into a square. This will allow you to achieve a square shape when you roll the dough. If the dough is sticky pat it with some flour. 3. Heat up a frying pan or griddle on the stove. When hot place the thinly rolled dough and let it cook for a minute or so. Once it starts to puff up flip the sabaayad and immediately spread a teaspoon of oil on top. Use a spatula to press down the bread all around. This makes it puff up more evenly.

They are crunchy outside, and soft and fragrant inside. In Swahili we call these delicious cakes vitumbua and macsharo in Somali. Growing up in Mombasa on the Kenyan coast I remember waking up to the call of the vitumbua sellers � vitumbua moto moto (hot, hot vitumbua ). Traditionally, we make the rice cakes in a small hollow pan which holds one cake at a time, but I couldn�t find this type of pan in Australia where I live now. Then a friend told me about the Danish Aebleskiver pan, a cast iron utensil that usually has nine holes � just perfect for cooking mini cakes and I was back in business! You can get the Aebleskiver pan on Amazon or eBay. Incidentally, the macsharo yariis recipe can also be used to make rice pancakes called vibibi and a rice cake also called macsharo or mkate wa sinia in Swahili. This recipe makes about 30 mini cakes.

    "Name": "Just my cup of tea � Somali shaah redolent with spices",
    "Description": "There is a fine tradition in Somali society known as casariya , a word that is loosely translated to mean afternoon tea. Wonderfully spiced tea called shaah in Somali is often served with various types of sweet or savoury treats. And you never, ever have shaah without sheeko (stories)! If you get invited to a Somali household for casariya beware that you won�t get asked how you like your tea. You will be served tea just the way Somalis like � full of spices and sugar! Cardamom is usually the strongest scent in Somali shaah . Somalis will often ask for tea that has so much cardamom that it should make the person sneeze! Tea with milk is called shaah cadays , however, it is customary to serve black tea called shaah bigays after a heavy meal. This recipe is from Nadia Faragaab aka the �Shaah Queen of Melbourne�. Nadia makes exceptional Somali shaah and always has a good sheeko or two up her sleeve! Nadia started making shaah when she was about 10 years. �My family decided that as the tomboy in the family I should learn to make shaah . It was a way of inducting me into housework,� she jokingly says. �I was also taught how to make canjeero (a Somali sourdough pancake) for breakfast, but I quickly realised that waking up at the crack of dawn wasn�t quite my thing. Making shaah wasn�t dependent on an early morning wake-up call so it became my thing,� adds Nadia. According to Nadia, the interesting thing about making shaah is that somehow each cook�s tea tastes different. �It is almost as if they�ve added a bit of themselves to the tea,� she says. Well, without much ado, here is Nadia�s shaah recipe. Make it your own! This recipe makes four cups of tea.

    "Name": "Somali Polenta Flat Bread (Muufo)",
    "Description": "Traditionally, Somalis bake muufo in a special clay oven called tinaar that is heated by charcoal. The muufo is flattened and stuck on the walls of the tinaar. No oil is ever used. You know the muufo is ready when it falls off the wall. � Muufo is a wonderful bread to serve with soup or stew. As Somalis settled in countries where they didn�t have access to a tinaar , they adapted by using a frying pan or a grill. Once the muufo is cooked on one side, the pan is flipped over to cook the other side directly over the gas flames. The result is an equally delicious flatbread though I have to say that the charcoal cooked tinaar gives the muufo a unique smoky flavour. Some people like to toast the muufo directly over the gas flames by flipping the frying pan onto the heat. This gives the muufo a charred look that makes the taste reminiscent of the muufo cooked in the traditional tinaar . Muufo cooked in this fashion is called muufo gedis (i.e. muufo that is turned). This method of cooking became popular in Somalia during the war as many small businesses such as the tinaar bakery shut down for safety reasons. Visits to the tinaar bakery are a nostalgic memory for girls who grew up in Somalia. It was the duty of young girls to buy the bread at the local tinaar . They would be given a tea towel or small bag to hold the bread and some money. Often, there would be a queue of people waiting for their muufo to be baked. The wait gave the girls a chance to catch up with friends and play. This recipe is from Faiza Hassan, a Somali Sydneysider, who is a wonderful cook. She remembers her mother making muufo in the tinaar in their house. It was years later in Australia that she wrote down her mother�s recipe and used the frying pan and grill to make the muufo bread.

This recipe, which I have adapted for breakfast, is a modern take on an ancient recipe. Hulled millet looks like little balls rather like couscous and are full of protein, vitamin B, silica manganese, magnesium, and phosphorous. These grains are easily available in markets if you are lucky enough to live in Africa. �Most middle eastern grocery stores stock hulled millet. Sorghum in seed form isn�t as easily available, but most Indian grocery stores stock it as ground flour. Both millet and sorghum flour make a great porridge if you are looking for an alternative to oats or corn.

    "Name": "Muqmad (Preserved Meat)",
    "Description": "If there is one dish that is quintessentially Somali this is it!� I call it meat jerky Somali style. For the nomadic Somali people, food at its most basic is all about meat and milk ( hilib iyo caano ) and muqmad or odkac �is up for there for my people. The harsh desert climate and the constant travel meant that Somalis had to invent ways to make foods that would last for long periods of time, such as muqmad or odkac � which is preserved meat. The muqmad would keep for up to one year, which made it a wonderful source of continuous protein and energy for the ever roving nomads. Huge amounts of meat would be cut into thin strips and then sun dried. After a couple of days in the sun, the meat would be cut into tiny half a centimetre cubes and then deep fried and preserved in ghee. Once the meat was cooked it would be kept in a wooden container. Muqmad is also prepared for weddings and placed in a special container called xeedho (in the picture), which is decorated with leather and sea shells.� The xeedho is then be wrapped in cloth and given as a gift to the groom�s family members. As a child I remember my grandmother slicing the meat in our backyard and hanging it on the washing line!� It was my job and that of my siblings to sit by the clothesline and shoo the birds away, much as my uncles and aunts did in the desert, except of course they didn�t have clotheslines to hang their meat on. This muqmad recipe is from my mother via her mother and grandmother � ladies who were true nomads or reer guraa as we say in Somali.� My grandmother always liked to flavour the ghee with a bit of onion, garlic and cardamom. She said it gave the meat a wonderful depth of flavour, and everyone who�tastes it�agrees! This recipe doesn�t require you to cure the meat by drying it in the sun, and takes a short cut by simply deep frying it. Our local butcher has many Somali customers and has learnt to cut the meat in muqmad or odkac �style.� If you aren�t as lucky as we are, dice the lean beef into tiny quarter centimetre cubes.

Somalis make their anjero in various ways. Some people add eggs to the batter. Others use flours such as sorghum. Some Somalis don�t ferment their batter, but I like my anjero fermented. Fermentation gives anjero a tangy sourdough taste that is very moreish! The fermentation process takes two days. Keep a cupful of fermented batter in the fridge to start a fresh batch if you want to make more anjero. Breads similar to anjero are common in Yemen (where it is called lahoh ) and Israel where it was introduced by Yemeni Jews.

Traditionally this is done using the hand, making a slapping sound. 2.��� Add in the two teaspoons of the fennel powder, onion and garlic. Continue mixing. Add a little bit of water if necessary to ensure that the batter is smooth. 3.��� Mix the yeast in a small bowl by adding water and add to the batter. 4.��� Add the yeast and continue mixing. 5.��� Add the saffron and black cumin and ordinary cumin. 6.��� Cover the batter and place in a warm place overnight. We usually heat the oven, switch it off and place the batter in the oven overnight. The humidity makes the batter rise and ferment. NB: the cambabuur batter should have the smooth consistency of pancake batter.

    "Name": "Sabaayad (Somali Flatbread)",
    "Description": "Sabaayad is similar to the Indian paratha. This is versatile bread that can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, dinner or just by itself. For breakfast it is eaten with muqmad (dried camel or beef jerky) or fried eggs and a cup of tea. For lunch or dinner it can be accompanied by beef, chicken or vegetable curries. �My favourite way to eat it is to drizzle some honey on the sabaayad . My grandmother used to say that you would know a good cook by the flakiness of their sabayaad . Well, here is how you can make yours as flaky as my granny would want it! You can use all purpose white flour, but this results in a chewy sabaayad. I prefer adding in wholemeal wheat flour which makes the sabaayad soft. To make a circular shaped sabaayad , use your hands to roll the circle from one end to form a cigar like roll. Hold one end and roll into a snake like coil and tuck the end in. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a thin circle. My grandmother rolled the dough twice applying oil with each roll. She said this makes the sabaayad extra flaky and I have to agree that this process does make for a super flaky bread. To make the sabaayad extra flaky roll the dough slightly after spreading the first tablespoonful of oil into a circle or a square. Roll it out again into a bigger circle or square ready for cooking.

To make the sabaayad square shaped, use a rolling pin to roll the circle and fold it into a square. This will allow you to achieve a square shape when you roll the dough.

Once it starts to puff up flip the sabaayad and immediately spread a teaspoon of oil on top. Use a spatula to press down the bread all around. This makes it puff up more evenly.

    "Name": "Mango Chicken Curry from a Somali kitchen in Minneapolis",
    "Description": "Chef Jamal Hashi, co-owner (with his brother Sade Hashi) of Safari Express East African Restaurant in Minneapolis, Minnesota says: �I owe it to the Italians that I make a �great marinara.� Hashi was born and raised in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, and immigrated to the US with his family as a teenager. Hashi says that Somali cuisine has been shaped by diverse influences over centuries and that it is fusion that makes the cuisine special. �Somalia was divided into three �parts: The north was �French, the middle was the�UK �red coats,� and the south, Italian.� He says: �You can�t say there�s Somali this or that, but each region is special. The �south is known for sweets, pasta, and marinara. The north gets influences from Djibouti. The way we use spice is different, from the north to the south.� With respect to home cooking in his family growing up, Hashi says: �My father specializes in seafood.� In Somalia, recipes are typically not written down, but passed down through family. Or, Hashi says: �People can guess, play around with the spices.� Hashi�s own interest �in cooking sparked at home. �Something about food called to me. It started as a hobby, in the home. I loved playing around with food, watching others cook for me. �There�s an artistry to it. Playing with fire, and the textures; it�s an art in a way. I love the gratitude of people when you serve it to them. It�s a good feeling.� Somalia�s location on the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden historically enabled active trading with India, Pakistan, and the Middle East, particularly Yemen. �We get mixed fusion, the cultures blended into one. So, we have curry with pasta. And beef marinara. We use both potatoes and pasta. Crepes with sesame oil and brown sugar is very common. In Ethiopia, their injera is soft and spongy, made from teff. Somali injera also includes butter and milk.� Most Somalis observe halal dietary guidelines. He says the rules govern �mostly how the meat is prepped.� While Somali cuisine may be unfamiliar to many Americans, opportunities to try it, particularly in Minneapolis, are increasing. According to the Minneapolis Foundation,�Minnesota is home to the country�s largest population of Somali residents.� Estimates vary, but the Confederation of Somali Community indicates that, since 1991, 100,000 Somalis have settled in the United States, 40,000 of which have settled or re-settled in Minnesota. Safari Express is one of the estimated (by the Minneapolis Foundation) 120 African-owned businesses, including markets and restaurants, along Minneapolis� Lake Street corridor. Chef Jamal Hashi graciously accommodated the Heavy Table�s request to spend an evening grocery shopping and cooking with us, in order to provide more insight into Somali cuisine. He showed us how to make a dish not available on the menu at Safari Express: Mango (Ambe, pronounced �ahm-bay�) Curry Chicken with Somali Rice, which is a colorful dish, fragrant with the scents of cumin and curry. It�s both mildly sweet and spicy. Says Hashi: �The mango brings the spice down and balances everything out.� Hashi kicked off our evening of shopping and cooking with a stop at The Produce Exchange, in Midtown Global Market in Minneapolis, in search of ripe mangoes. �I love using organic produce at home and at Safari Express, too. It tastes like the way we do it back home. Fruits don�t taste like fruits here [in the US]. There are lots of good things about organics: They are good for your system, have fewer chemicals, and have health benefits over the long-term. And it supports local businesses.� He says that a ripe mango �should be a little soft when you squeeze it. The firmer it is, the more sour it is. It doesn�t matter what color the skin is: it might be green, but still sweet.� As Hashi patiently sorted through the mangoes, gently squeezing each one, a process that took several minutes, he said: �Back home, we had a big mango tree behind our house. It was our neighbors� tree, but half hung over",

Jamal�s version, called bizbaz , is particularly delicious and has layers of complex flavour that belie its simple ingredients. There are many versions of this chilli sauce ( bisbas , basbas , or shidni are the various names given to this type of sauce). Common ingredients include yoghurt, tomato, tamarind, lime or lemon, sugar, dates, and of course chilli. You can serve this chilli sauce with almost anything.

    "Name": "Fried coffee, anyone? (Bun Soomaali)",
    "Description": "Fried coffee? I know what you are thinking! It sounds weird, right? But let me tell you the taste is incredible and Somalis have some interesting stories that we associate with the bean. My beloved maternal grandparents introduced me to fried coffee beans at the tender age of five. This special dish was offered during meditation sessions called dhikr , an Islamic form of devotional chanting in praise of God. Somehow to this day, the smell of coffee brings to mind the sonorous, repetitive and ancient sounds of sacred chant, and I get instantly transported to a state of mental clarity. The d hikr group would sit on a mat and the coffee would be served floating in oil in a kurbin , a special wooden bowl. The kurbin would be passed around and we would start with a deep and appreciative sniff of the wonderful aroma, and then ladle a spoonful of the coffee onto the palm, chew the beans, and then rub the scented oil over our faces. This was part of the ritual and was said to prepare the person to face the world. Sometimes sugar is added to the bun to sweeten it.� Bun is also often eaten with popcorn or a simple dish of boiled azuki beans known as cambuulo . Coffee beans are called� bun �in the Somali language, and� buna �in Oromo and� bunna �in Amharic, the two other main languages of Ethiopia, the home of coffee. Somalis also associate bun with rites and spirit possession practices that hint at the ancient beliefs of Somalis. Ceremonies are held by a ritual expert, calanqad . Dancing, drumming, bun and the burning of incense are used to enhance the senses of participants. The spirit descends on the host under various names, sometimes speaking in different languages. Men and women participate in a ceremony called mingis , but women have their own ceremony called saar . If the spirit is vexatious, an exorcism is conducted by the calanqad . Not all spirits are cast out. Some become friends of the possessed person and are sometimes inherited by the children. Fried coffee beans also play a central role in ceremonies women hold to pray for the safe delivery of a pregnant friend. The oil used to fry the coffee beans is applied liberally on the head and hair of the pregnant woman as the women pray and sing for their friend. The Oromo people of Ethiopia, a Cushitic tribe like the Somali, also have a fried coffee ceremony. The outer skin is snipped off the coffee beans and words of blessings are uttered in a ritual known as buna-chiru , which signifies sacrifice to honour a guest or for a ceremony. Don�t forget to moisturise your face with some of the coffee flavoured oil! If you�ve read this far then you should keep in touch!� Like The Somali Kitchen on�Facebook .

    "Name": "Shidni (Chilli Sauce with Tamarind)",
    "Description": "This spicy chilli sauce is a favourite of all Somalis. Usually it is made as described below, but some people add dates. Another version is made with onions, tomatoes and lemon or with dates and tamarind . We have shidni with almost every meal. You can get tamarind either whole or in a paste form in any Indian or Somali grocery store. I recommend the paste as it is easier to use. The tamarind tree, which is called raqay or xamar in Somali (the latter is also the local name for the Somali capital Mogadishu) grows in the tropical parts of East Africa, including southern Somalia. The tree produces fleshy pods that are brown or reddish-brown when mature. The pods are soaked in water and squeezed to produce a thick acidic paste. When we were children we loved mixing the juice with water and sugar to make a refreshing drink, but that is a recipe for another day! Give shidni a go if you want to add a spicy kick to your meal. Incidentally, shidni makes a great dip for French fries or Dorito chips. Remember to pick the variety of chillies carefully. The colour and size of chillies are not indicative of the intensity of their flavour. The hottest part of the chilli is the membrane and the seeds. You can remove these to reduce the heat. You don�t want it too hot if you can�t bear the heat! And if the shidni is too hot please don�t drink water. Sipping some milk or yoghurt cools you down much faster. Want to learn getting your Somali pronunciation right? In Somali, the letter x is pronounced as an emphatic version of the letter h . If you are not Somali here is a fun way to learn how to make this sound�swallow a good spoonful of really hot shidni sauce. Did you just make an exhaling sound when the heat of the chilli hit your palate? Well, that is a good approximation of the Somali x ! Now that you have mastered this unique sound try saying xamar , the Somali word for tamarind. If you�ve read this far then you should keep in touch!� Like The Somali Kitchen on�Facebook .

    "Description": "I enjoy giving tradition a new twist so when a Vietnamese friend served me some vegetables in a lettuce cup I thought I would try that idea on Somali food. Combining meat and salad seemed like a good way to go and my suqaar lettuce cup recipe was born. Suqaar is Somali diced stir-fry beef or lamb made simply with onion, tomato and sometimes a bit of spice. It is usually eaten with canjeero (a sourdough flat bread or sabaayad , a wheat flatbread). The suqaar lettuce cups were a great success in my Somali kitchen. My family said that the combination of spicy meat and the crunch and freshness of the lettuce leaves made for a memorable entr�e dish.

    "Name": "Muqmad (Preserved Meat)",
    "Description": "If there is one dish that is quintessentially Somali this is it!� I call it meat jerky Somali style. For the nomadic Somali people, food at its most basic is all about meat and milk ( hilib iyo caano ) and muqmad or odkac �is up for there for my people. The harsh desert climate and the constant travel meant that Somalis had to invent ways to make foods that would last for long periods of time, such as muqmad or odkac � which is preserved meat. The muqmad would keep for up to one year, which made it a wonderful source of continuous protein and energy for the ever roving nomads. Huge amounts of meat would be cut into thin strips and then sun dried. After a couple of days in the sun, the meat would be cut into tiny half a centimetre cubes and then deep fried and preserved in ghee. Once the meat was cooked it would be kept in a wooden container. Muqmad is also prepared for weddings and placed in a special container called xeedho (in the picture), which is decorated with leather and sea shells.� The xeedho is then be wrapped in cloth and given as a gift to the groom�s family members. As a child I remember my grandmother slicing the meat in our backyard and hanging it on the washing line!� It was my job and that of my siblings to sit by the clothesline and shoo the birds away, much as my uncles and aunts did in the desert, except of course they didn�t have clotheslines to hang their meat on. This muqmad recipe is from my mother via her mother and grandmother � ladies who were true nomads or reer guraa as we say in Somali.� My grandmother always liked to flavour the ghee with a bit of onion, garlic and cardamom. She said it gave the meat a wonderful depth of flavour, and everyone who�tastes it�agrees! This recipe doesn�t require you to cure the meat by drying it in the sun, and takes a short cut by simply deep frying it. Our local butcher has many Somali customers and has learnt to cut the meat in muqmad or odkac �style.� If you aren�t as lucky as we are, dice the lean beef into tiny quarter centimetre cubes. Muqmad is a favourite breakfast food and is usually eaten with sabaayad bread or anjero . If you�ve read this far then you should keep in touch!� Like The Somali Kitchen on�Facebook .

I cooked my first Zab when I was fifteen years of age for twenty people at my niece�s wanqal (a traditional Somali naming ceremony). This was a great achievement for me, and years later Zab has become my signature dish! This is a slow cooking dish, but most of the work will be done for you by the oven so don�t be scared to try it. I guarantee you that the results will be worth it! Serve the big chunks of tender meat on a bed of rice in a big dish for a Zab effect. There should be plenty to share for more than eight hungry people! If you have leftovers wrap the lamb in baking paper and a layer of foil paper.

    "Description": "Shushumow , a crisp, deep fried shell shaped pastry made with flour, eggs and water is a sweet made during festive times such as weddings and religious celebrations among the Somali people. The shushumow also known as kalkals or zinanaande �(in Somali and Barawa languages) is shaped into small balls that is flattened and curled over a fork, deep fried and then tossed in a sugar syrup. The pastry shells are shaped using a fork and sometimes an afro comb (yes, you read that correctly, but of course use a new and sanitised one!). This recipe is courtesy of Hibo Jama of MyHalwad , a great instagram page that you should visit.�Hibo says that she chose the name MyHalwad �because she loves halwa (or xalwa , a popular Somali sweet). �I love xalwad . One day I was craving for it, but where I used to live there was no one who made it. They only got it from other cities. So I called my sister, and as always she told me how to cook xalwa over the phone step by step. It took me about ten tries or so, but I finally got it. Now I put my own twist on it, and that is where the name MyHalwad came from. Xalwa is one of my favorite things to cook,� she says. Hibo started cooking when she was a teenager, but the passion for cooking kicked some years later. �Now I love cooking and baking, and I have been cooking different cuisines for the last 14 years. I don�t have a favorite when it comes what to cooking. I just put my love into whatever I am making,� she adds.

Print  Shushumow (Somali Crystallised Pastry Shells)  Author:  Abderazzaq Noor  Recipe by:  Hibo Jama of MyHalwad Ingredients Shushumow dough 1 _ cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoon of sugar _ teaspoon salt _ teaspoon baking powder 1/3 cup of canola oil 1 large egg 3 tablespoon of warm water (more or less) 2 cups of canola oil (for frying) Sugar syrup _ cup sugar _ cup water _ ground cardamom (optional) Supplies for shaping the shushumow A flat board A fork or new afro comb (you can get this online). Make sure the comb is new and sanitised, and only use it for the shushumow . Instructions Preparing the shushumow 1. In an electric mixer mix all dough ingredients together except the water (and frying oil of course!) 2. Add the water slowly until you get soft dough. Mix for about 4-5 minutes. 3. Then let the dough rest for about 30 minutes. 4. Next cut the dough into small pieces roughly 1 inch x 1 inch. This should give you about 30 shushumow . 5. Shape them one at a time by pressing the dough on the back of the fork and curl it out toward the opposite side (away from you) 6. Preheat oil on medium heat. Fry the shushumow in the preheated oil a few at time, until golden brown. Make sure you turn the pastry frequently so that it cooks evenly. 7. Take them out and place them on a few layers of paper towels. This helps drain the oil from pastry. Preparing the syrup 1. For the syrup, use a medium size pan combine the sugar, cardamom and water together and let it come to a boil. Simmer for a couple of minutes and turn off the heat. 2. Then add all the shushumow to the pan and stir gently and ensure an even coating of the syrup. 3. Take the shushumow out and put them on a plate and let them cool down. The sugar will crystallise, but that�s part of the charm of shushumow ! Enjoy with a cup of Somali shaah .

    "Name": "Black Quinoa, Hulled Millet, Artichoke and Pomegranate Salad",
    "Description": "The inspiration for this recipe came from one of my favourite chefs, vegan guru Tal Ronen who likes to use ancient grains. Tapping into my own ancient Horn of Africa heritage with its African and Middle Eastern influences I have used hulled millet, pomegranate and added ingredients that I don�t usually use such as black quinoa and artichokes. Millet is a common food in much of Africa where it is eaten as a breakfast food in the form of porridge. It is also cooked into a stiff polenta like dish that is served with either vegetables or a meat based sauce.�While many rave about quinoa, millet is not as well known in the western world, but it should be. It is a smart carb that is low GI and has been shown to produce lower blood sugar levels than wheat or rice. (Kamari and Sumathi, 2002). I also used artichokes in this recipe, a vegetable that I am not very familiar with. I have included pictures of how they look like before and after preparation below. Slice about 3/4 inch to an inch off the tip of the artichoke. Pull off any smaller leaves towards the base and on the stem. Wash them in cold water and boil them for about 30 minutes in water. See picture below for what the artichokes should look like once prepared. And this is what your dish could look like once cooked and all the ingredients assembled on the serving plate.

    "Description": "Chilli is often served as a condiment in Somali cuisine and rarely added to the dish. This makes Somali food perfect for those who like flavour without the heat, but for those who like it hot�the more the chilli the better! This wonderful recipe was inspired by American Somali chef, Jamal Hashi , who runs the Safari Express restaurant in Minneapolis. Jamal�s version, called bizbaz , is particularly delicious and has layers of complex flavour that belie its simple ingredients. There are many versions of this chilli sauce ( bisbas , basbas , or shidni are the various names given to this type of sauce). Common ingredients include yoghurt, tomato, tamarind, lime or lemon, sugar, dates, and of course chilli. You can serve this chilli sauce with almost anything. I love it with french fries, wedges, in a burger, with rice, drizzled over roast vegetables or meat�the possibilities are endless.

Another popular use of labneh is to mix it with herbs and shape it into balls, which are then stored in olive oil. This can be eaten as a cheese.

    "Description": "I was beyond flattered when I given the daunting challenge of putting my own twist to the famous chef Tal Ronnen�s vegan menu at the Wynn Luxury Resort in Las Vegas. I started the task with quite a bit of trepidation! This guy is one of the world�s most celebrated chefs, runs the Crossroads restaurant in Los Angeles, and is the author of The Conscious Cook, a New York Times bestselling cookbook. Tal Ronnen is also someone Oprah calls the world�s best vegan chef. I was also daunted by the fact that I had to choose one dish from the menus of the numerous restaurants at the Wynn , named in the�Cond� Nast Traveller� Gold List �as one of the �Top Hotels in the World�. I chose an organic olive oil seared tofu dish prepared with sundried tomatoes, green onions, ginger and lemon soy from Andrea�s, a Forbes Travel Guide Four Star award winning restaurant. I wanted to put a Somali touch to this dish and the idea of using fenugreek seeds and leaves came to mind. Fenugreek is used as a herb (fresh or dried) and a spice when in seed form. In Somali, we call it� hulbad (xulbad) . It is used to spice food and also as a herbal medicine to help women who are breast feeding improve their milk flows. I also decided to substitute the sun dried tomatoes in the original dish with fresh red and gold cherry tomatoes and saut�ed them in fenugreek flavoured oil and lime juice. The resulting juices acted as my dressing and was used in lieu of the lemon soy. I also added rocket leaves as I thought their peppery flavour would go well with the other ingredients. I was delighted with the delicate flavour imparted by the distinctive sweetness of the fenugreek seeds. The fresh tartness of the lime and the slightly caramelised onions, rocket, tomatoes and ginger added a tasty layer of flavour to the tofu. This is definitely a dish that I will cook again. Tal Ronnen, if you ever happen to read my humble take on your dish I hope you think I did a good interpretation! �And to anyone who uses this recipe, I hope you will enjoy the dish as much as I did.

    "Name": "Mango Chicken Curry from a Somali kitchen in Minneapolis",
    "Description": "Chef Jamal Hashi, co-owner (with his brother Sade Hashi) of Safari Express East African Restaurant in Minneapolis, Minnesota says: �I owe it to the Italians that I make a �great marinara.� Hashi was born and raised in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, and immigrated to the US with his family as a teenager. Hashi says that Somali cuisine has been shaped by diverse influences over centuries and that it is fusion that makes the cuisine special. �Somalia was divided into three �parts: The north was �French, the middle was the�UK �red coats,� and the south, Italian.� He says: �You can�t say there�s Somali this or that, but each region is special. The �south is known for sweets, pasta, and marinara. The north gets influences from Djibouti. The way we use spice is different, from the north to the south.� With respect to home cooking in his family growing up, Hashi says: �My father specializes in seafood.� In Somalia, recipes are typically not written down, but passed down through family. Or, Hashi says: �People can guess, play around with the spices.� Hashi�s own interest �in cooking sparked at home. �Something about food called to me. It started as a hobby, in the home. I loved playing around with food, watching others cook for me. �There�s an artistry to it. Playing with fire, and the textures; it�s an art in a way. I love the gratitude of people when you serve it to them. It�s a good feeling.� Somalia�s location on the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden historically enabled active trading with India, Pakistan, and the Middle East, particularly Yemen. �We get mixed fusion, the cultures blended into one. So, we have curry with pasta. And beef marinara. We use both potatoes and pasta. Crepes with sesame oil and brown sugar is very common. In Ethiopia, their injera is soft and spongy, made from teff. Somali injera also includes butter and milk.� Most Somalis observe halal dietary guidelines. He says the rules govern �mostly how the meat is prepped.� While Somali cuisine may be unfamiliar to many Americans, opportunities to try it, particularly in Minneapolis, are increasing. According to the Minneapolis Foundation,�Minnesota is home to the country�s largest population of Somali residents.� Estimates vary, but the Confederation of Somali Community indicates that, since 1991, 100,000 Somalis have settled in the United States, 40,000 of which have settled or re-settled in Minnesota. Safari Express is one of the estimated (by the Minneapolis Foundation) 120 African-owned businesses, including markets and restaurants, along Minneapolis� Lake Street corridor. Chef Jamal Hashi graciously accommodated the Heavy Table�s request to spend an evening grocery shopping and cooking with us, in order to provide more insight into Somali cuisine. He showed us how to make a dish not available on the menu at Safari Express: Mango (Ambe, pronounced �ahm-bay�) Curry Chicken with Somali Rice, which is a colorful dish, fragrant with the scents of cumin and curry. It�s both mildly sweet and spicy. Says Hashi: �The mango brings the spice down and balances everything out.� Hashi kicked off our evening of shopping and cooking with a stop at The Produce Exchange, in Midtown Global Market in Minneapolis, in search of ripe mangoes. �I love using organic produce at home and at Safari Express, too. It tastes like the way we do it back home. Fruits don�t taste like fruits here [in the US]. There are lots of good things about organics: They are good for your system, have fewer chemicals, and have health benefits over the long-term. And it supports local businesses.� He says that a ripe mango �should be a little soft when you squeeze it. The firmer it is, the more sour it is. It doesn�t matter what color the skin is: it might be green, but still sweet.� As Hashi patiently sorted through the mangoes, gently squeezing each one, a process that took several minutes, he said: �Back home, we had a big mango tree behind our house. It was our neighbors� tree, but half hung over",

    "Name": "Polenta African Style (Soor)",
    "Description": "This stiff, porridge like dish made from maize flour and water is practically the national dish in many African countries. In Somali we call this African dish soor . It is usually eaten using the hand. You pick up a small amount using three fingers and form a ball to scoop vegetables or meat. It won�t take long to get the hang of eating this way, but do take your time if you are eating with me as I usually get a kick watching novices try! Soor has many names around Africa� sima or ugali in Kenya and Tanzania where it is also made using maize flour though sometimes red millet flour is used as well. In Malawi and Zambia it is called nsima,�pap or mealie in South Africa. In west African countries such as Nigeria a soor like variation called fufu is made using cassava flour. Soor has a subtle almost bland flavour that is best matched with a fully flavoured vegetable or meat dish. In Somalia butter and milk is sometimes added to the ingredients to soften the soor . In most other African countries the dish is made with just maize flour and water. At times I add various other flavourings such as a pinch of black pepper and cheese and it tastes amazing. It is said that when you eat soor it sticks to your ribs, keeping you full and satisfied for longer. Serve with vegetables or meat such as suqaar or lamb and potato sugo . I love eating soor with yoghurt and a drizzle of honey. Many Somalis like to eat soor with milk and sugar.

    "Description": "These delicious bite sized rice cakes are a traditional Swahili breakfast and snack favourite, but I was delighted when I encountered them in the coastal cities of southern Somalia. They are crunchy outside, and soft and fragrant inside. In Swahili we call these delicious cakes vitumbua and macsharo in Somali. Growing up in Mombasa on the Kenyan coast I remember waking up to the call of the vitumbua sellers � vitumbua moto moto (hot, hot vitumbua ). Traditionally, we make the rice cakes in a small hollow pan which holds one cake at a time, but I couldn�t find this type of pan in Australia where I live now. Then a friend told me about the Danish Aebleskiver pan, a cast iron utensil that usually has nine holes � just perfect for cooking mini cakes and I was back in business! You can get the Aebleskiver pan on Amazon or eBay. Incidentally, the macsharo yariis recipe can also be used to make rice pancakes called vibibi and a rice cake also called macsharo or mkate wa sinia in Swahili. This recipe makes about 30 mini cakes. Serve warm with a cup of tea. If eating later, warm the cakes to soften the rice and enhance the flavours.

    "Name": "Just my cup of tea � Somali shaah redolent with spices",
    "Description": "There is a fine tradition in Somali society known as casariya , a word that is loosely translated to mean afternoon tea. Wonderfully spiced tea called shaah in Somali is often served with various types of sweet or savoury treats. And you never, ever have shaah without sheeko (stories)! If you get invited to a Somali household for casariya beware that you won�t get asked how you like your tea. You will be served tea just the way Somalis like � full of spices and sugar! Cardamom is usually the strongest scent in Somali shaah . Somalis will often ask for tea that has so much cardamom that it should make the person sneeze! Tea with milk is called shaah cadays , however, it is customary to serve black tea called shaah bigays after a heavy meal. This recipe is from Nadia Faragaab aka the �Shaah Queen of Melbourne�. Nadia makes exceptional Somali shaah and always has a good sheeko or two up her sleeve! Nadia started making shaah when she was about 10 years. �My family decided that as the tomboy in the family I should learn to make shaah . It was a way of inducting me into housework,� she jokingly says. �I was also taught how to make canjeero (a Somali sourdough pancake) for breakfast, but I quickly realised that waking up at the crack of dawn wasn�t quite my thing. Making shaah wasn�t dependent on an early morning wake-up call so it became my thing,� adds Nadia. According to Nadia, the interesting thing about making shaah is that somehow each cook�s tea tastes different. �It is almost as if they�ve added a bit of themselves to the tea,� she says. Well, without much ado, here is Nadia�s shaah recipe. Make it your own! This recipe makes four cups of tea.

How to wrap the sambuus pastry (see pictures above) 1: Thaw the spring roll pastry and cover with a clean cloth to keep the pastry from drying out. 2: Mix two tablespoons of plain flour with a quarter cup of warm water to form a paste to seal the pastry�s edge. 3: Cut the two pastry sheets into thirds of equal size rectangles.� Repeat for the rest of the pastries, using two sheets at a time. In total, you will have 15 rectangles, each forming into one sambuus. Ensure that the pastry pieces are always kept covered with a clean cloth. 4: Fold the two sheets of rectangular pastry into pockets � see picture below. 5: Fill the pocket with about two tablespoons of the vegetable mixture. 6: Spread the flour paste along the edges of the final fold and seal the pastry completely. Ensure that the pastry does not have any holes.� You should have a neat triangular sambuus . A well folded sambuus will fry crisply and won�t be oily. 7: Repeat the process of filling and folding with the remaining pieces of pastry. Keep the pasties covered in cloth to ensure they don�t dry out. Frying the sambuus 1: Heat up oil in a deep frying pan on medium heat. Test the oil with a small strip of excess dough and if the pastry floats up then you are ready to start frying your sambuus . 2: Fry several sambuus at a time until they are a nice golden colour. 3: Drain the sambuus on a clean kitchen towel and serve with a wedge of lemon, lime or shidni sauce. � Prep time: 30 minutes Cook time: 2 hours Total time: 2.5 hours Serves: 8 - 10 people Share this recipe: Facebook Pinterest Google+ Twitter Email You might also like",

    "Description": "Fried coffee? I know what you are thinking! It sounds weird, right? But let me tell you the taste is incredible and Somalis have some interesting stories that we associate with the bean. My beloved maternal grandparents introduced me to fried coffee beans at the tender age of five. This special dish was offered during meditation sessions called dhikr , an Islamic form of devotional chanting in praise of God. Somehow to this day, the smell of coffee brings to mind the sonorous, repetitive and ancient sounds of sacred chant, and I get instantly transported to a state of mental clarity. The d hikr group would sit on a mat and the coffee would be served floating in oil in a kurbin , a special wooden bowl. The kurbin would be passed around and we would start with a deep and appreciative sniff of the wonderful aroma, and then ladle a spoonful of the coffee onto the palm, chew the beans, and then rub the scented oil over our faces. This was part of the ritual and was said to prepare the person to face the world. Sometimes sugar is added to the bun to sweeten it.� Bun is also often eaten with popcorn or a simple dish of boiled azuki beans known as cambuulo . Coffee beans are called� bun �in the Somali language, and� buna �in Oromo and� bunna �in Amharic, the two other main languages of Ethiopia, the home of coffee. Somalis also associate bun with rites and spirit possession practices that hint at the ancient beliefs of Somalis. Ceremonies are held by a ritual expert, calanqad . Dancing, drumming, bun and the burning of incense are used to enhance the senses of participants. The spirit descends on the host under various names, sometimes speaking in different languages. Men and women participate in a ceremony called mingis , but women have their own ceremony called saar . If the spirit is vexatious, an exorcism is conducted by the calanqad . Not all spirits are cast out. Some become friends of the possessed person and are sometimes inherited by the children. Fried coffee beans also play a central role in ceremonies women hold to pray for the safe delivery of a pregnant friend. The oil used to fry the coffee beans is applied liberally on the head and hair of the pregnant woman as the women pray and sing for their friend. The Oromo people of Ethiopia, a Cushitic tribe like the Somali, also have a fried coffee ceremony. The outer skin is snipped off the coffee beans and words of blessings are uttered in a ritual known as buna-chiru , which signifies sacrifice to honour a guest or for a ceremony.

    "Name": "Somali Polenta Flat Bread (Muufo)",
    "Description": "Traditionally, Somalis bake muufo in a special clay oven called tinaar that is heated by charcoal. The muufo is flattened and stuck on the walls of the tinaar. No oil is ever used. You know the muufo is ready when it falls off the wall. � Muufo is a wonderful bread to serve with soup or stew. As Somalis settled in countries where they didn�t have access to a tinaar , they adapted by using a frying pan or a grill. Once the muufo is cooked on one side, the pan is flipped over to cook the other side directly over the gas flames. The result is an equally delicious flatbread though I have to say that the charcoal cooked tinaar gives the muufo a unique smoky flavour. Some people like to toast the muufo directly over the gas flames by flipping the frying pan onto the heat. This gives the muufo a charred look that makes the taste reminiscent of the muufo cooked in the traditional tinaar . Muufo cooked in this fashion is called muufo gedis (i.e. muufo that is turned). This method of cooking became popular in Somalia during the war as many small businesses such as the tinaar bakery shut down for safety reasons. Visits to the tinaar bakery are a nostalgic memory for girls who grew up in Somalia. It was the duty of young girls to buy the bread at the local tinaar . They would be given a tea towel or small bag to hold the bread and some money. Often, there would be a queue of people waiting for their muufo to be baked. The wait gave the girls a chance to catch up with friends and play. This recipe is from Faiza Hassan, a Somali Sydneysider, who is a wonderful cook. She remembers her mother making muufo in the tinaar in their house. It was years later in Australia that she wrote down her mother�s recipe and used the frying pan and grill to make the muufo bread.

Hulled millet looks like little balls rather like couscous and are full of protein, vitamin B, silica manganese, magnesium, and phosphorous.

    "Description": "I don�t know what is more delicious � the dish or the story behind the origin of the dish�read on and you can decide for yourself� Umm Ali literally means the mother of Ali in Arabic. It is one of the most scrumptious bread puddings it has been my fortune to eat! Let�s get to the story now.� There are many variations of the story, but I have picked the most common one.� Umm Ali was the first wife the sultan Ezz El Din Aybek, whose rule began in 1250.� When the sultan died it was expected that the throne would pass onto the first wife�s first son � Ali.� However, the second wife also wanted her son to be the sultan. So Umm Ali arranged to pave the way to the throne for her son, Ali in a rather unique way.� She bribed wife number two�s handmaids and got them to beat her to death with slippers while she was having a bath! It is said that Umm Ali then made this dessert to celebrate her victory and her son, Ali�s ascension to the throne. There are many variations of the Umm Ali dessert. Some use different kinds of bread � pita, puff pastry, croissants or filo pastry or different nuts such as pistachio, almonds, and hazelnuts, among others. As children we used to eat a much simpler version made with sabaayad , a Somali flatbread, sugar and milk.� This recipe is my own take on the Egyptian Umm Ali, substituting pita bread or filo pastry (which is generally what is used in Egypt) with the Somali sabaayad and adding nuts, cream and spices. If you want to use sabaayad , you can find the recipe here.� It is equally delicious made with puff pastry.

    "Name": "Cardamom, Yoghurt and Fruit Pavlova",
    "Description": "My 11 year old son, Ilyas, is a determined fellow. Once he has his mind set on something, he�s got to do it. Fortunately, this time it was something quite innocuous. He just wanted to make something for his cousin�s birthday � something Australian and Somali, and preferably a meringue type cake, he said. You can�t get more Aussie than a pavlova or as we call it here � pav. The challenge was to somehow appropriate this classic Australian dessert into something Somali!� We hit on adding cardamom and yoghurt to give it that little twist. There is an interesting story about the origins of this delicious cake. Both Australia and New Zealand claim ownership of the dessert.� The truth is that no one knows who created the pavlova. The name and the recipe first began appearing soon after Russian prima ballerina, Anna Matveyevna Pavlova (1881-1931), toured both Australia and New Zealand in 1926 and Australia again in 1929. In 2010, the Oxford English Dictionary waded into the controversy and ruled that the first recorded pavlova recipe appeared in New Zealand in 1927. Of course, the dictionary folk are only interested in the origin of the word, but I am sure they had some fun riling up the Aussies and New Zealanders!� No doubt, the debate will continue especially now that we have muddied up the waters with the Somali appropriation of this wonderful dessert!� Here is hoping that the pav will find its way into the Somali lexicon probably as �baf� as we don�t have �p� or �v� in the Somali language! The cake turned out to be a massive hit and was finished in one sitting and we have received requests for a repeat performance. Happy birthday, Faiza!

Luqaimat , a puffy sweet fried dumpling dipped in honey or syrup, is a firm favourite in our household during Ramadhan, the Islamic month of fasting.� But because we have a sweet tooth, luqaimat makes a rather more frequent appearance in our Somali kitchen! Luqaimat is the Arabic word that some Somalis use for these delicious dumplings.� We also call them burka macan . Amongst the Swahili people of Kenya and Tanzania, they are called kaimati . In Melbourne, where we live the Greek community (the largest Greek-speaking population outside of Europe, after Athens and Thessaloniki!) also make exactly the same sweet, which they call loukoumades . Crunchy on the outside and soft and airy in the middle, luqaimat are often dipped in honey or sugar syrup (see recipe below), but I prefer to coat them with icing sugar.

According to history, it was also the favourite of one of the world�s most beautiful women � Cleopatra of Egypt!� The vegetable resembles a lady�s finger. I wonder if this is why she liked the vegetable or is it because okra is said to keep the skin smooth and beautiful? Anyway, back to my recipe, the mix of okra, spices, the sweetness of the tomato and the tanginess of the tamarind or lemon creates a wonderful explosion of flavour. In this recipe I have used frozen okra, which you can get from Asian grocery stores. The addition of lemon or tamarind eliminates the sticky substance that okra releases when cooked. In Somali, we call this wonderful vegetable baamiye . Maraq means sauce hence Maraq baamiye � okra with sauce.

Halwa is often served with strong black coffee called qahwa. The bitterness of the coffee cuts the sweetness of the halwa .

Making halwa is a laborious process. This is why it has become the speciality of artisans.� Every Somali neighbourhood has at least one reputed halwa maker. Sometimes we add nuts or sesame seeds.

    "Name": "Muqmad (Preserved Meat)",
    "Description": "If there is one dish that is quintessentially Somali this is it!� I call it meat jerky Somali style. For the nomadic Somali people, food at its most basic is all about meat and milk ( hilib iyo caano ) and muqmad or odkac �is up for there for my people. The harsh desert climate and the constant travel meant that Somalis had to invent ways to make foods that would last for long periods of time, such as muqmad or odkac � which is preserved meat. The muqmad would keep for up to one year, which made it a wonderful source of continuous protein and energy for the ever roving nomads. Huge amounts of meat would be cut into thin strips and then sun dried. After a couple of days in the sun, the meat would be cut into tiny half a centimetre cubes and then deep fried and preserved in ghee. Once the meat was cooked it would be kept in a wooden container. Muqmad is also prepared for weddings and placed in a special container called xeedho (in the picture), which is decorated with leather and sea shells.� The xeedho is then be wrapped in cloth and given as a gift to the groom�s family members. As a child I remember my grandmother slicing the meat in our backyard and hanging it on the washing line!� It was my job and that of my siblings to sit by the clothesline and shoo the birds away, much as my uncles and aunts did in the desert, except of course they didn�t have clotheslines to hang their meat on. This muqmad recipe is from my mother via her mother and grandmother � ladies who were true nomads or reer guraa as we say in Somali.� My grandmother always liked to flavour the ghee with a bit of onion, garlic and cardamom. She said it gave the meat a wonderful depth of flavour, and everyone who�tastes it�agrees! This recipe doesn�t require you to cure the meat by drying it in the sun, and takes a short cut by simply deep frying it. Our local butcher has many Somali customers and has learnt to cut the meat in muqmad or odkac �style.� If you aren�t as lucky as we are, dice the lean beef into tiny quarter centimetre cubes. Muqmad is a favourite breakfast food and is usually eaten with sabaayad bread or anjero . If you�ve read this far then you should keep in touch!� Like The Somali Kitchen on�Facebook .

    "Description": "Fish is popular in my home town of Kismayo, a port city in southern Somalia.� Established about 1,000 years ago by Persian and Arab traders, the food in Kismayo, like in much of the port cities of Somalia, is an exotic blend of African and Middle Eastern flavours. In Kismayo, we eat malai with a salad and a kind of bread called mufo , a dense, tart and chewy cornmeal-based flatbread, which is similar to pita bread or Indian naan bread. This recipe is from my mother and I�love cooking fish this way in my Somali kitchen. Malai Kismayo goes beautifully with a fresh salad.

We eat them for breakfast, drizzled with butter and a sprinkle of sugar. Anjero also makes a regular appearance at our lunch and dinner tables, usually served with a meat based stew ( maraq ). Anjero (written as canjeero in Somali) is also known as lahooh ( laxoox ). It is similar to the massive sized Ethiopian injera bread. The Somali version is smaller � dinner plate sized and thinner. Somalis make their anjero in various ways. Some people add eggs to the batter. Others use flours such as sorghum. Some Somalis don�t ferment their batter, but I like my anjero fermented. Fermentation gives anjero a tangy sourdough taste that is very moreish! The fermentation process takes two days. Keep a cupful of fermented batter in the fridge to start a fresh batch if you want to make more anjero. Breads similar to anjero are common in Yemen (where it is called lahoh ) and Israel where it was introduced by Yemeni Jews. Moroccans also make a similar bread called baghrir and eat it drizzled with honey and butter.

Our house in Malindi was like a little bakery. We would start cooking at 6am, making samosas and other pastries for my mother�s shop and my brother�s restaurant. It was my job to help stuff the samosas with meat or vegetables and fold them up. I was also the delivery person, dropping off the hot pastries at the restaurant on my way to school. Thanks to the demands of the shop and restaurant we got to enjoy samosas everyday! This recipe is based on how my mother made her samosas. Everything is made from scratch.

Place in the fridge for one hour. I use two meats because beef on its own can be dry while lamb on its own is too oily. So the combination gives you a lovely tasting meat. 2.�Dice the onion and chop the coriander. 3.�Saute the mince in a sauce pan until cooked through. 4.�Add the onion and coriander and cook for a minute or two. 5.�Season with salt. 6.�Let the mixture cool. Samosa pastry 1.�Place plain flour, oil and the warm water in the bowl and mix until you have a smooth dough 2.�Divide the dough into small tennis ball sized pieces 3.�Roll three dough balls out flat, each to size of a saucer. 4.�Spread a little oil on top of each round and stack them one on top of the other. The oil prevents the� dough rounds sticking to each other. 5.�Roll the stacks to roughly the size of a dinner place. Cut into quarters. 6.�Dry fry the quarters on both sides one at a time for a minute on each side. Don�t overcook! 7.�When each quarter is dry-fried separate them and wrap with plastic. How to wrap the samosas 1.�Mix two tablespoons of plain flour with a quarter cup of warm water to form a paste to seal the samosa edge. 2.�Form each quarter into a cone shape by folding the sides from the rounded end over each other and seal with the paste. You should have a cone shape with a triangular shaped top that looks like an ice cream cone. 3.�Fill the cone with the mince mixture. 4.�Tuck the pointed top end down over the sealed edges and seal with the paste. You should now have a neat triangular samosa. Repeat with remaining pieces of pastry. Cooking the samosas 1.�Heat the oil in heavy shallow frying pan over medium heat. Test the oil with a small strip of excess dough and if the pastry floats up then you are ready to start frying your samosas. 2.�Place several samosas in your frying pan. Turn to brown to a light gold. 3.�Drain the cooked samosas on paper. � Prep time: 1 hour Cook time: 20 minutes Total time: 1 hour and 20 minutes Serves: 6 - 8 people Share this recipe: Facebook Pinterest Google+ Twitter Email You might also like",

    "Description": "Zab is the name given to a Somali dish of roast lamb or goat served over a bed of rice. The dish is usually served during weddings or community gatherings known as Zab or alla bari . Consequently many call the dish Zab . When I came to Australia I cooked Zab almost every other week. This was a great way to bring together my husband�s extended family and for my children to get to know their family and learn about the Somali culture. I cooked my first Zab when I was fifteen years of age for twenty people at my niece�s wanqal (a traditional Somali naming ceremony). This was a great achievement for me, and years later Zab has become my signature dish! This is a slow cooking dish, but most of the work will be done for you by the oven so don�t be scared to try it. I guarantee you that the results will be worth it! Serve the big chunks of tender meat on a bed of rice in a big dish for a Zab effect. There should be plenty to share for more than eight hungry people! If you have leftovers wrap the lamb in baking paper and a layer of foil paper.

Marinate the meat in large dish with spices, garlic and ginger for two hours in the fridge or preferably overnight. 2. Transfer to a big sauce pan � we have a special sauce pan for just this dish!� Add all the other ingredients except for the vegetables and place on the stove. Make sure your lid is airtight. Cook for an hour on stove on low heat. It will brown and you might be worried the meat is burning during the first ten minutes, but don�t worry as this gives the meat a delicious smoky flavour.� The meat will produce steam which will add to the meat�s juices. 3.

For breakfast it is eaten with muqmad (dried camel or beef jerky) or fried eggs and a cup of tea. For lunch or dinner it can be accompanied by beef, chicken or vegetable curries. �My favourite way to eat it is to drizzle some honey on the sabaayad . My grandmother used to say that you would know a good cook by the flakiness of their sabayaad . Well, here is how you can make yours as flaky as my granny would want it! You can use all purpose white flour, but this results in a chewy sabaayad. I prefer adding in wholemeal wheat flour which makes the sabaayad soft. To make a circular shaped sabaayad , use your hands to roll the circle from one end to form a cigar like roll. Hold one end and roll into a snake like coil and tuck the end in. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a thin circle. My grandmother rolled the dough twice applying oil with each roll. She said this makes the sabaayad extra flaky and I have to agree that this process does make for a super flaky bread. To make the sabaayad extra flaky roll the dough slightly after spreading the first tablespoonful of oil into a circle or a square. Roll it out again into a bigger circle or square ready for cooking.

Mix all the flour together with the salt. Add the oil and mix in thoroughly. Add in the water slowly as you knead the dough. When you are satisfied that you have a firm and elastic dough you know you�ve got it right. Let the dough rest for about half an hour. 2. Cut the dough into eight equal portions. Roll out each portion into a circle. Spread one teaspoon of oil and rub it gently all over the surface of the dough. To make the sabaayad square shaped, use a rolling pin to roll the circle and fold it into a square. This will allow you to achieve a square shape when you roll the dough. If the dough is sticky pat it with some flour. 3. Heat up a frying pan or griddle on the stove. When hot place the thinly rolled dough and let it cook for a minute or so. Once it starts to puff up flip the sabaayad and immediately spread a teaspoon of oil on top. Use a spatula to press down the bread all around. This makes it puff up more evenly.

    "Description": "This spicy chilli sauce is a favourite of all Somalis. Usually it is made as described below, but some people add dates. Another version is made with onions, tomatoes and lemon or with dates and tamarind . We have shidni with almost every meal. You can get tamarind either whole or in a paste form in any Indian or Somali grocery store. I recommend the paste as it is easier to use. The tamarind tree, which is called raqay or xamar in Somali (the latter is also the local name for the Somali capital Mogadishu) grows in the tropical parts of East Africa, including southern Somalia. The tree produces fleshy pods that are brown or reddish-brown when mature. The pods are soaked in water and squeezed to produce a thick acidic paste. When we were children we loved mixing the juice with water and sugar to make a refreshing drink, but that is a recipe for another day! Give shidni a go if you want to add a spicy kick to your meal. Incidentally, shidni makes a great dip for French fries or Dorito chips. Remember to pick the variety of chillies carefully. The colour and size of chillies are not indicative of the intensity of their flavour. The hottest part of the chilli is the membrane and the seeds. You can remove these to reduce the heat. You don�t want it too hot if you can�t bear the heat! And if the shidni is too hot please don�t drink water. Sipping some milk or yoghurt cools you down much faster. Want to learn getting your Somali pronunciation right? In Somali, the letter x is pronounced as an emphatic version of the letter h . If you are not Somali here is a fun way to learn how to make this sound�swallow a good spoonful of really hot shidni sauce. Did you just make an exhaling sound when the heat of the chilli hit your palate? Well, that is a good approximation of the Somali x !

    "Description": "The inspiration for this recipe came from one of my favourite chefs, vegan guru Tal Ronen who likes to use ancient grains. Tapping into my own ancient Horn of Africa heritage with its African and Middle Eastern influences I have used hulled millet, pomegranate and added ingredients that I don�t usually use such as black quinoa and artichokes. Millet is a common food in much of Africa where it is eaten as a breakfast food in the form of porridge. It is also cooked into a stiff polenta like dish that is served with either vegetables or a meat based sauce.�While many rave about quinoa, millet is not as well known in the western world, but it should be. It is a smart carb that is low GI and has been shown to produce lower blood sugar levels than wheat or rice. (Kamari and Sumathi, 2002). I also used artichokes in this recipe, a vegetable that I am not very familiar with. I have included pictures of how they look like before and after preparation below. Slice about 3/4 inch to an inch off the tip of the artichoke. Pull off any smaller leaves towards the base and on the stem. Wash them in cold water and boil them for about 30 minutes in water. See picture below for what the artichokes should look like once prepared. And this is what your dish could look like once cooked and all the ingredients assembled on the serving plate.

    "Description": "Shushumow , a crisp, deep fried shell shaped pastry made with flour, eggs and water is a sweet made during festive times such as weddings and religious celebrations among the Somali people. The shushumow also known as kalkals or zinanaande �(in Somali and Barawa languages) is shaped into small balls that is flattened and curled over a fork, deep fried and then tossed in a sugar syrup. The pastry shells are shaped using a fork and sometimes an afro comb (yes, you read that correctly, but of course use a new and sanitised one!). This recipe is courtesy of Hibo Jama of MyHalwad , a great instagram page that you should visit.�Hibo says that she chose the name MyHalwad �because she loves halwa (or xalwa , a popular Somali sweet). �I love xalwad . One day I was craving for it, but where I used to live there was no one who made it. They only got it from other cities. So I called my sister, and as always she told me how to cook xalwa over the phone step by step. It took me about ten tries or so, but I finally got it. Now I put my own twist on it, and that is where the name MyHalwad came from. Xalwa is one of my favorite things to cook,� she says. Hibo started cooking when she was a teenager, but the passion for cooking kicked some years later. �Now I love cooking and baking, and I have been cooking different cuisines for the last 14 years.

Make sure the comb is new and sanitised, and only use it for the shushumow . Instructions Preparing the shushumow 1. In an electric mixer mix all dough ingredients together except the water (and frying oil of course!) 2. Add the water slowly until you get soft dough. Mix for about 4-5 minutes. 3. Then let the dough rest for about 30 minutes. 4. Next cut the dough into small pieces roughly 1 inch x 1 inch. This should give you about 30 shushumow . 5. Shape them one at a time by pressing the dough on the back of the fork and curl it out toward the opposite side (away from you) 6. Preheat oil on medium heat. Fry the shushumow in the preheated oil a few at time, until golden brown. Make sure you turn the pastry frequently so that it cooks evenly. 7. Take them out and place them on a few layers of paper towels. This helps drain the oil from pastry. Preparing the syrup 1. For the syrup, use a medium size pan combine the sugar, cardamom and water together and let it come to a boil. Simmer for a couple of minutes and turn off the heat. 2. Then add all the shushumow to the pan and stir gently and ensure an even coating of the syrup. 3. Take the shushumow out and put them on a plate and let them cool down. The sugar will crystallise, but that�s part of the charm of shushumow ! Enjoy with a cup of Somali shaah .

    "Description": "These delicious bite sized rice cakes are a traditional Swahili breakfast and snack favourite, but I was delighted when I encountered them in the coastal cities of southern Somalia. They are crunchy outside, and soft and fragrant inside. In Swahili we call these delicious cakes vitumbua and macsharo in Somali. Growing up in Mombasa on the Kenyan coast I remember waking up to the call of the vitumbua sellers � vitumbua moto moto (hot, hot vitumbua ). Traditionally, we make the rice cakes in a small hollow pan which holds one cake at a time, but I couldn�t find this type of pan in Australia where I live now. Then a friend told me about the Danish Aebleskiver pan, a cast iron utensil that usually has nine holes � just perfect for cooking mini cakes and I was back in business! You can get the Aebleskiver pan on Amazon or eBay. Incidentally, the macsharo yariis recipe can also be used to make rice pancakes called vibibi and a rice cake also called macsharo or mkate wa sinia in Swahili. This recipe makes about 30 mini cakes. Serve warm with a cup of tea. If eating later, warm the cakes to soften the rice and enhance the flavours.

    "Description": "I don�t know what is more delicious � the dish or the story behind the origin of the dish�read on and you can decide for yourself� Umm Ali literally means the mother of Ali in Arabic. It is one of the most scrumptious bread puddings it has been my fortune to eat! Let�s get to the story now.� There are many variations of the story, but I have picked the most common one.� Umm Ali was the first wife the sultan Ezz El Din Aybek, whose rule began in 1250.� When the sultan died it was expected that the throne would pass onto the first wife�s first son � Ali.� However, the second wife also wanted her son to be the sultan. So Umm Ali arranged to pave the way to the throne for her son, Ali in a rather unique way.� She bribed wife number two�s handmaids and got them to beat her to death with slippers while she was having a bath! It is said that Umm Ali then made this dessert to celebrate her victory and her son, Ali�s ascension to the throne. There are many variations of the Umm Ali dessert. Some use different kinds of bread � pita, puff pastry, croissants or filo pastry or different nuts such as pistachio, almonds, and hazelnuts, among others. As children we used to eat a much simpler version made with sabaayad , a Somali flatbread, sugar and milk.� This recipe is my own take on the Egyptian Umm Ali, substituting pita bread or filo pastry (which is generally what is used in Egypt) with the Somali sabaayad and adding nuts, cream and spices.

    "Name": "Cardamom, Yoghurt and Fruit Pavlova",
    "Description": "My 11 year old son, Ilyas, is a determined fellow. Once he has his mind set on something, he�s got to do it. Fortunately, this time it was something quite innocuous. He just wanted to make something for his cousin�s birthday � something Australian and Somali, and preferably a meringue type cake, he said. You can�t get more Aussie than a pavlova or as we call it here � pav. The challenge was to somehow appropriate this classic Australian dessert into something Somali!� We hit on adding cardamom and yoghurt to give it that little twist. There is an interesting story about the origins of this delicious cake. Both Australia and New Zealand claim ownership of the dessert.� The truth is that no one knows who created the pavlova. The name and the recipe first began appearing soon after Russian prima ballerina, Anna Matveyevna Pavlova (1881-1931), toured both Australia and New Zealand in 1926 and Australia again in 1929. In 2010, the Oxford English Dictionary waded into the controversy and ruled that the first recorded pavlova recipe appeared in New Zealand in 1927. Of course, the dictionary folk are only interested in the origin of the word, but I am sure they had some fun riling up the Aussies and New Zealanders!� No doubt, the debate will continue especially now that we have muddied up the waters with the Somali appropriation of this wonderful dessert!� Here is hoping that the pav will find its way into the Somali lexicon probably as �baf� as we don�t have �p� or �v� in the Somali language! The cake turned out to be a massive hit and was finished in one sitting and we have received requests for a repeat performance. Happy birthday, Faiza!

During weddings and on major Islamic festivals such as Eid ul Fitr, kilos of halwa are either made or bought from the halwa makers and served to guests. Halwa is often served with strong black coffee called qahwa. The bitterness of the coffee cuts the sweetness of the halwa . Various forms of halwa exist in the Arab world and India.� The closest versions to Somali halwa are found in Yemen, Oman and the Kenyan and Tanzanian Indian Ocean coastal region. Making halwa is a laborious process. This is why it has become the speciality of artisans.� Every Somali neighbourhood has at least one reputed halwa maker. Sometimes we add nuts or sesame seeds. This gives the halwa a delicious crunch. Halwa can be preserved for several months and does not need to be refrigerated.

    "Description": "Kac Kac (pronounced ka�ka�) is a deep-fried bread, similar to a New Orleans beignet. It is prepared in every Somali household during the fasting month of Ramadan, Eid festivals and wedding ceremonies. These festivals were never the same without kac kac . It is also great served hot for breakfast. Every Somali who went to a boarding school in East Africa will agree with me that kac kac was a delicacy that all boarding school students had to take to school. It certainly made us popular with our fellow students! Kac Kac is easy to carry and remains fresh for a long time in an airtight container. Its ability to stay fresh made kac kac a practical food for Somali nomads ( reer guraa ) and travellers to take on their long road trips, which would sometimes take months. Kac kac is also a wonderful snack for children�s school lunch, or as an afternoon snack when they come home. Serve with a nice spiced Somali� shaah (spiced tea). � If you�ve read this far then you should keep in touch!� Like The Somali Kitchen on�Facebook .

    "Name": "Fenugreek oil seared tofu, spring onions, cherry tomatoes with ginger and lime",
    "Description": "I was beyond flattered when I given the daunting challenge of putting my own twist to the famous chef Tal Ronnen�s vegan menu at the Wynn Luxury Resort in Las Vegas. I started the task with quite a bit of trepidation! This guy is one of the world�s most celebrated chefs, runs the Crossroads restaurant in Los Angeles, and is the author of The Conscious Cook, a New York Times bestselling cookbook. Tal Ronnen is also someone Oprah calls the world�s best vegan chef. I was also daunted by the fact that I had to choose one dish from the menus of the numerous restaurants at the Wynn , named in the�Cond� Nast Traveller� Gold List �as one of the �Top Hotels in the World�. I chose an organic olive oil seared tofu dish prepared with sundried tomatoes, green onions, ginger and lemon soy from Andrea�s, a Forbes Travel Guide Four Star award winning restaurant. I wanted to put a Somali touch to this dish and the idea of using fenugreek seeds and leaves came to mind. Fenugreek is used as a herb (fresh or dried) and a spice when in seed form. In Somali, we call it� hulbad (xulbad) . It is used to spice food and also as a herbal medicine to help women who are breast feeding improve their milk flows. I also decided to substitute the sun dried tomatoes in the original dish with fresh red and gold cherry tomatoes and saut�ed them in fenugreek flavoured oil and lime juice. The resulting juices acted as my dressing and was used in lieu of the lemon soy. I also added rocket leaves as I thought their peppery flavour would go well with the other ingredients. I was delighted with the delicate flavour imparted by the distinctive sweetness of the fenugreek seeds. The fresh tartness of the lime and the slightly caramelised onions, rocket, tomatoes and ginger added a tasty layer of flavour to the tofu. This is definitely a dish that I will cook again. Tal Ronnen, if you ever happen to read my humble take on your dish I hope you think I did a good interpretation! �And to anyone who uses this recipe, I hope you will enjoy the dish as much as I did.

They are crunchy outside, and soft and fragrant inside. In Swahili we call these delicious cakes vitumbua and macsharo in Somali. Growing up in Mombasa on the Kenyan coast I remember waking up to the call of the vitumbua sellers � vitumbua moto moto (hot, hot vitumbua ). Traditionally, we make the rice cakes in a small hollow pan which holds one cake at a time, but I couldn�t find this type of pan in Australia where I live now. Then a friend told me about the Danish Aebleskiver pan, a cast iron utensil that usually has nine holes � just perfect for cooking mini cakes and I was back in business! You can get the Aebleskiver pan on Amazon or eBay. Incidentally, the macsharo yariis recipe can also be used to make rice pancakes called vibibi and a rice cake also called macsharo or mkate wa sinia in Swahili. This recipe makes about 30 mini cakes. Serve warm with a cup of tea. If eating later, warm the cakes to soften the rice and enhance the flavours.

How to wrap the sambuus pastry (see pictures above) 1: Thaw the spring roll pastry and cover with a clean cloth to keep the pastry from drying out. 2: Mix two tablespoons of plain flour with a quarter cup of warm water to form a paste to seal the pastry�s edge. 3: Cut the two pastry sheets into thirds of equal size rectangles.� Repeat for the rest of the pastries, using two sheets at a time. In total, you will have 15 rectangles, each forming into one sambuus. Ensure that the pastry pieces are always kept covered with a clean cloth. 4: Fold the two sheets of rectangular pastry into pockets � see picture below. 5: Fill the pocket with about two tablespoons of the vegetable mixture. 6: Spread the flour paste along the edges of the final fold and seal the pastry completely. Ensure that the pastry does not have any holes.� You should have a neat triangular sambuus . A well folded sambuus will fry crisply and won�t be oily. 7: Repeat the process of filling and folding with the remaining pieces of pastry. Keep the pasties covered in cloth to ensure they don�t dry out. Frying the sambuus 1: Heat up oil in a deep frying pan on medium heat. Test the oil with a small strip of excess dough and if the pastry floats up then you are ready to start frying your sambuus . 2: Fry several sambuus at a time until they are a nice golden colour. 3: Drain the sambuus on a clean kitchen towel and serve with a wedge of lemon, lime or shidni sauce. � Prep time: 30 minutes Cook time: 2 hours Total time: 2.5 hours Serves: 8 - 10 people Share this recipe: Facebook Pinterest Google+ Twitter Email You might also like",

    "Name": "Somali Polenta Flat Bread (Muufo)",
    "Description": "Traditionally, Somalis bake muufo in a special clay oven called tinaar that is heated by charcoal. The muufo is flattened and stuck on the walls of the tinaar. No oil is ever used. You know the muufo is ready when it falls off the wall. � Muufo is a wonderful bread to serve with soup or stew. As Somalis settled in countries where they didn�t have access to a tinaar , they adapted by using a frying pan or a grill. Once the muufo is cooked on one side, the pan is flipped over to cook the other side directly over the gas flames. The result is an equally delicious flatbread though I have to say that the charcoal cooked tinaar gives the muufo a unique smoky flavour. Some people like to toast the muufo directly over the gas flames by flipping the frying pan onto the heat. This gives the muufo a charred look that makes the taste reminiscent of the muufo cooked in the traditional tinaar . Muufo cooked in this fashion is called muufo gedis (i.e. muufo that is turned). This method of cooking became popular in Somalia during the war as many small businesses such as the tinaar bakery shut down for safety reasons. Visits to the tinaar bakery are a nostalgic memory for girls who grew up in Somalia. It was the duty of young girls to buy the bread at the local tinaar . They would be given a tea towel or small bag to hold the bread and some money. Often, there would be a queue of people waiting for their muufo to be baked. The wait gave the girls a chance to catch up with friends and play. This recipe is from Faiza Hassan, a Somali Sydneysider, who is a wonderful cook. She remembers her mother making muufo in the tinaar in their house. It was years later in Australia that she wrote down her mother�s recipe and used the frying pan and grill to make the muufo bread.

    "Name": "Fenugreek oil seared tofu, spring onions, cherry tomatoes with ginger and lime",
    "Description": "I was beyond flattered when I given the daunting challenge of putting my own twist to the famous chef Tal Ronnen�s vegan menu at the Wynn Luxury Resort in Las Vegas. I started the task with quite a bit of trepidation! This guy is one of the world�s most celebrated chefs, runs the Crossroads restaurant in Los Angeles, and is the author of The Conscious Cook, a New York Times bestselling cookbook. Tal Ronnen is also someone Oprah calls the world�s best vegan chef. I was also daunted by the fact that I had to choose one dish from the menus of the numerous restaurants at the Wynn , named in the�Cond� Nast Traveller� Gold List �as one of the �Top Hotels in the World�. I chose an organic olive oil seared tofu dish prepared with sundried tomatoes, green onions, ginger and lemon soy from Andrea�s, a Forbes Travel Guide Four Star award winning restaurant. I wanted to put a Somali touch to this dish and the idea of using fenugreek seeds and leaves came to mind. Fenugreek is used as a herb (fresh or dried) and a spice when in seed form. In Somali, we call it� hulbad (xulbad) . It is used to spice food and also as a herbal medicine to help women who are breast feeding improve their milk flows. I also decided to substitute the sun dried tomatoes in the original dish with fresh red and gold cherry tomatoes and saut�ed them in fenugreek flavoured oil and lime juice. The resulting juices acted as my dressing and was used in lieu of the lemon soy. I also added rocket leaves as I thought their peppery flavour would go well with the other ingredients. I was delighted with the delicate flavour imparted by the distinctive sweetness of the fenugreek seeds. The fresh tartness of the lime and the slightly caramelised onions, rocket, tomatoes and ginger added a tasty layer of flavour to the tofu. This is definitely a dish that I will cook again. Tal Ronnen, if you ever happen to read my humble take on your dish I hope you think I did a good interpretation! �And to anyone who uses this recipe, I hope you will enjoy the dish as much as I did.

How to wrap the sambuus pastry (see pictures above) 1: Thaw the spring roll pastry and cover with a clean cloth to keep the pastry from drying out. 2: Mix two tablespoons of plain flour with a quarter cup of warm water to form a paste to seal the pastry�s edge. 3: Cut the two pastry sheets into thirds of equal size rectangles.� Repeat for the rest of the pastries, using two sheets at a time. In total, you will have 15 rectangles, each forming into one sambuus. Ensure that the pastry pieces are always kept covered with a clean cloth. 4: Fold the two sheets of rectangular pastry into pockets � see picture below. 5: Fill the pocket with about two tablespoons of the vegetable mixture. 6: Spread the flour paste along the edges of the final fold and seal the pastry completely. Ensure that the pastry does not have any holes.� You should have a neat triangular sambuus . A well folded sambuus will fry crisply and won�t be oily. 7: Repeat the process of filling and folding with the remaining pieces of pastry. Keep the pasties covered in cloth to ensure they don�t dry out. Frying the sambuus 1: Heat up oil in a deep frying pan on medium heat. Test the oil with a small strip of excess dough and if the pastry floats up then you are ready to start frying your sambuus . 2: Fry several sambuus at a time until they are a nice golden colour. 3: Drain the sambuus on a clean kitchen towel and serve with a wedge of lemon, lime or shidni sauce. � Prep time: 30 minutes Cook time: 2 hours Total time: 2.5 hours Serves: 8 - 10 people Share this recipe: Facebook Pinterest Google+ Twitter Email You might also like",

    "Description": "Okra is one of my favourite vegetarian dishes. According to history, it was also the favourite of one of the world�s most beautiful women � Cleopatra of Egypt!� The vegetable resembles a lady�s finger. I wonder if this is why she liked the vegetable or is it because okra is said to keep the skin smooth and beautiful? Anyway, back to my recipe, the mix of okra, spices, the sweetness of the tomato and the tanginess of the tamarind or lemon creates a wonderful explosion of flavour. In this recipe I have used frozen okra, which you can get from Asian grocery stores. The addition of lemon or tamarind eliminates the sticky substance that okra releases when cooked. In Somali, we call this wonderful vegetable baamiye . Maraq means sauce hence Maraq baamiye � okra with sauce. Maraq Baamiye goes well with any kind of flatbread like sabaayad or steamed rice.� Leftovers are great as a sandwich filling.
